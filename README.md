# Active-Learning

## Text Classification using `CNN` & `Active Learning` strategies:

In this project, I built a CNN model to classify documents into their emotions class correctly.
The model was trained using various active learning querying strategies such as uncertainty sampling, entropy sampling ..etc.
I made use of the TensorFlow framework to build the main model architecture, and modAL for the active learning trainer model.
The final accuracy across the testing dataset was ~ 0.8810, and F1_score was ~ 0.8257.
